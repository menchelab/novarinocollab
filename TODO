1. implement meta-reaction clustering as described in the COMPASS paper

2. use relevant subsystems as defined by Lisa to further reduce the number of statistical tests

3. generate vulcanos for each of the subsystems after statistical testing

4. investigate the impact of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism on enrichment
(is the found upregulation of fat ox merely an effect of general upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism in KO compared to WT)

5. perform COMPASS analysis on time series data P4 vs E14.5, Adult vs P4 for glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons
this will require micropooling or subsampling as especially Adult has large numbers of neurons
